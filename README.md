The goal of the game is to remove all bricks with a ball that is hit by the player. A
brick is removed once it has been hit by the player’s ball. The ball bounces
off the removed brick. The player’s ball is controlled by a paddle. The ball
bounces from all edges but the lower edge. If the ball hits the lower edge of
the playing area, a life is lost. A player has up to three lives. If all bricks are
removed from the player’s screen, the game advances to the next level. If the
player has no more lives left, the game is over. If the high score is in the
current top 10, the game asks the player, if an entry to the high score list is
desired. After each played game, the player should see the welcome screen
